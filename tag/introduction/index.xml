      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to samherreid.io! A new hub for my content spanning a handful of, not always complementary, fixations. My first personal website, samherreid.org, went live in June 2018 as a primarily academic website. It had some footnotes to my other interests, but was built specifically for the eyes of potential employers. I never said â€˜â€˜fuckâ€™â€™ on samherreid.org. But things are changing&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the domain extension. No one has time to comment on things, those that do occupy a beautiful few percentages of our population. When samherreid.org launched there wasnâ€™t public commenting, but a few people privately messaged me, laughing at my ambitious organization designation. It made some sense to me because it was a well-known extension and Iâ€™m not a commercial entity. But now that I am a co-founder of an actual nonprofit organization, I decided to switch my personal website to the trendy .io extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this website still has a comprehensive presentation of my science, I decided to ditch the selective resume format and host all of my creative fields in on one central &amp;ndash; and not social media &amp;ndash; location. Am I still applying for postdocs with a link to this website on my CV? Yes ðŸ˜…, but I guess Iâ€™ve decided to be my whole self here, which means expect inline emojis and jokes about eating Tide Pods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new website has an uncomplicated comments section on all posts, articles and projects and I challenge you to be in the few percent who leave a comment, joke, question or criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
