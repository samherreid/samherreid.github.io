    <h2><a href="/publication/denali/">Why is Denali (6,194 m) so big? Caught inside the tectonic wake of a migrating restraining bend</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Topography along strike-slip fault restraining bends is theoretically self-limited by erosion, block translation and the expected abandonment of fault bends. However, Denali (6,194 m) and Foraker (5,304 m) are located within a restraining bend of the dextral Denali Fault system. We reveal the role of bend evolution in mountain building with physical experiments scaled to simulate the Alaska Mount McKinley restraining bend (MMRB). Despite the natural complexity of the MMRB, first-order patterns (of strike-slip separation rates, uplift and lateral bend migration) from the geologic data align with patterns from scaled experiments.

[Below] Oblique image of Canwell Glacier from the same helicopter flight used to capture the (straight downward-looking) images above (July 29th, 2016 11:00 AM local Alaska time). Rock debris on the surface of a glacier can dramatically reduce the local melt rate, where the primary factor governing melt reduction is debris layer thickness.

    <h2><a href="/publication/marincliffs/">Mapping ice cliffs on debris-covered glaciers using multispectral satellite images</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Ice cliffs play a key role in the mass balance of debris-covered glaciers, but assessing their importance is limited by a lack of datasets on their distribution and evolution at scales larger than an individual glacier. These datasets are often derived using operator-biased and time-consuming manual delineation approaches, despite the recent emergence of semi-automatic mapping methods. These methods have used elevation or multispectral data, but the varying slope and mixed spectral signal of these dynamic features makes the transferability of these ap-proaches particularly challenging.

      A summary of this paper written in accessable language for the Nature Sustainability Community &ldquo;Behind the Paper&rdquo; series is available here.
Rock debris can accumulate on glacier surfaces and dramatically reduce glacier melt. The structure of a debris cover is unique to each glacier and sensitive to climate. Despite this, debris cover has been omitted from global glacier models and forecasts of their response to a changing climate. Fundamental to resolving these omissions is a global map of debris cover and an estimate of its future spatial evolution.

    <h2><a href="/icecliffs_featured_old/">Automated detection of ice cliffs within supraglacial debris cover</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Ice cliffs within a supraglacial debris cover have been identified as a source for high ablation relative to the surrounding debris-covered area. Due to their small relative size and steep orientation, ice cliffs are difficult to detect using nadir-looking space borne sensors. The method presented here uses surface slopes calculated from digital elevation model (DEM) data to map ice cliff geometry and produce an ice cliff probability map. Surface slope thresholds, which can be sensitive to geographic location and/or data quality, are selected automatically.

    <h2><a href="/publication/surge/">Automated detection of unstable glacier flow and a spectrum of speedup behavior in the Alaska Range</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Surge‐type glaciers are loosely defined as glaciers that experience periodic alterations between slow and fast flow regimes. Glaciers from a variety of mountain ranges around the world have been classified as surge type, yet consensus of what defines a glacier as surge type has not always been met. A common source of dispute is the lack of a succinct and globally applicable delimiter between a surging and nonsurging glacier. The attempt is often a Boolean classification; however, glacier speedup events can vary significantly with respect to event magnitude, duration, and the fraction of the glacier that participates in the speedup.

    <h2><a href="/publication/pakistan/">Satellite observations show no net change in the percentage of supraglacial debris-covered area in northern Pakistan from 1977 to 2014</a></h2>
    <div class="article-style">
      
      Spatial evolution of supraglacial debris cover on mountain glaciers is a largely unmonitored and poorly understood phenomenon that directly affects glacier melt. Supraglacial debris cover for 93 glaciers in the Karakoram, northern Pakistan, was mapped from Landsat imagery acquired in 1977, 1998, 2009 and 2014. Surge-type glaciers occupy 41% of the study area and were considered separately. The time series of debris-covered surface area change shows a mean value of zero or near-zero change for both surging and non-surging glaciers.
