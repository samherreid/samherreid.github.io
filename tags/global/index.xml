      <description>In order to derive a global debris cover map at an operative quality, the Randolph Glacier Inventory Version 6.0 needed to be corrected and updated. Becasue I was the sole glaciologist to manually correct this dataset, there is now a heightened level of cosistency that has never before been present in a global glacier dataset.
With a high confidence map of glacier area and debris cover, an equilibrium line estimate can be made for glaciers with sufficient debris cover.</description>
