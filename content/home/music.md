In 2021 I bought a baby grand piano and I'm working on writing and recording an EP of songs capturing the lifestyle and culture around ultra trail running. I'm not exactly sure what the end product will be, since I write simultaneously for tracked out recording, but also single take live performances. I'm not sure if a Spotify album would be strictly one, or the other, or possibly a mix or two versions of each track ðŸ˜‚

Aside from polished albums, I like releasing music as soon as I make it, which is what is posted here. Two tracks on the forthcoming album. Are they demos? Are they final cuts with fun raw blemishes? No one really knows. All I can say is I have a piano in my living room and when I hear a song in my head it isn't too long before its a file on my laptop. And very likely here on this website. 

The latest track, Chamonix, was recorded in a single take playing piano, drums and singing at the same time. The back story and lyrics are in the YouTube notes.
