My work is focused on regional to global scale methods, analyses and products that improve our understanding of Earth's glaciers. I am developing *Debris Cover Tools*, a suite of open-source, automated tools that provide glaciologists with an accessible and easy to implement approach to account for rock debris on glaciers. While my end focus is on large scale processes, there is a lot of very small scale work behind it, down to individual glaciers and individual rock clasts within a debris cover. This work is centered around the Alaska Range at locations that have been nearly, or entirely untouched by previous glaciologists. Specifically, I started a field program on Canwell Glacier as an undergraduate in 2011 and have been collecting new and repeat data there on a near-annual basis. While a lot of research on debris cover has been conducted on select glaciers in the European Alps and Himalayas, nearly none have been studied in Alaska. Because of this, I have focused my small scale and regional work in the Alaska Range while completing my PhD in Europe. I hope to establish a process understanding that holds between Alaska, the Himalaya, Europe and the rest of Earth's glaciers.
