**Writing**

My [first comedy writing](https://www.irunfar.com/why-tamales-are-good-for-the-planet-the-trail-and-you), a pro-litter yet somehow still environmentally conscientious piece, was published in October 2021 on irunfar.com.

[Dakota Jones](https://www.clifbar.com/athletes/dakota-jones) wrote [a blog post](https://thatdakotajones.medium.com/a-glacier-scientist-goes-running-e9adc3ede38c) that tells the story of my mixing science and running in the context of energy and climate education.  

I wrote a [short commentary](https://trailrunnermag.com/destinations/international/a-glaciologist-in-chamonix.html) in the February 2020 edition of Trail Runner Magazine on the tangible evidence of a changing climate someone running in an alpine setting will encounter.
