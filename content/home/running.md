<h2>Past:</h2>
  
  
My running since I bought a Suunto watch in 2019:  
(Yellow = run; blue = openwater ocean swim; green = hike; orange = bike)

2021 was a difficult year, the gaps in March correspond to working non-stop on the first draft of "What can thermal imagery tell us about glacier melt below rock debris?", and the smaller gaps in May and June were intensive rounds of revisions. In July I sprained my ankle once, and then two more times in August from training in denial. While I was still able to run roads to some degree, my running was limited until around November. Of course through it all, paper writing and an ankle the size of a New Jersey peach, I was still working 30-35 hrs/week pouring bougie lattes :)  
  
While I do not race often, below is a link to my International Trail Running Association (ITRA) résumé:

Rather than race, I enjoy running un/self-supported trail and urban ultras on my own. They are usually the result of a momentary random fixation on a challenge or destination and the run usually happens within a few days of the idea nucleation :)  

This running style is predicated on long, off-trail runs in the Alaska Range that filled the summer months of my 20s and came before I ever thought to buy a GPS watch to track them. Most were done alone alongside fiedlwrok, but I participated in a few events and races during this time: [AlaskaCross](https://www.newsminer.com/features/outdoors/twelve-adventurous-competitors-tackle-100-mile-alaskacross-course/article_932600aa-1658-11e5-ad1c-83467e260409.html), [White Mountains 100](http://wm100.endurancenorth.org/2014-results) (skiing) x2 finishes, [Iditasport](https://www.iditasport.com/) (225 mile event, skiing, sctatched at mile 90, only career DNF), [Drew's Angel Creek 50](https://angelcreek50.org/results-2015/), [Yukon River Trail Marathon](https://www.yukon-news.com/sports/roots-mchale-top-the-field-in-river-trail-marathon/) in Whitehorse Yukon Territory Canada x3 finishes, and 9 consecutive [Equninox Marathon](https://www.adn.com/sports/article/saari-plays-catchup-collect-fifth-equinox-marathon-title/2015/09/20/) finishes from 2007 to 2015, before moving to The UK for graduate school.  

Since leaving Alaska, and buying my first GPS watch, I've run a steady volume of self-supported trail and urban ultras with a special love for "My front door to ..." routes with public transportation back home. Here are some of my favorites:

<h2>Writing</h2>

My [first comedy writing](https://www.irunfar.com/why-tamales-are-good-for-the-planet-the-trail-and-you), a pro-litter yet somehow still environmentally conscientious piece, was published in October 2021 on irunfar.com.

[Dakota Jones](https://www.clifbar.com/athletes/dakota-jones) wrote [a blog post](https://thatdakotajones.medium.com/a-glacier-scientist-goes-running-e9adc3ede38c) that tells the story of my mixing science and running in the context of energy and climate education.  

I wrote a [short commentary](https://trailrunnermag.com/destinations/international/a-glaciologist-in-chamonix.html) in the February 2020 edition of Trail Runner Magazine on the tangible evidence of a changing climate someone running in an alpine setting will encounter.
