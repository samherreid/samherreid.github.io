I am a **postdoc at the OSU Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center** working on exciting new carbon-free energy resources. I decided to shift to green energy because it is an exceptionally fast paced field with a lot of potential to make a societal contribution. More so than my fixation on studying rocks on glaciers, but I still independently work on this problem because I like it. And it contributes to better understanding future water resources and sea level rise. My publications on glaciers have spanned field studies in Alaska to global analyses. Currently, I am writing an **open-source forward model predicting the distribution of rock debris on glaciers** several hundreds of years into the future.

Open scientific knowledge is foundational to human advances. Foundational knowledge is often not directly coupled to profit and cannot be truncated by political boundaries. Currently in academics, the dissuasion for junior scientists to continue to pursue foundational research is palpable. This needs to change. To contribute to this effort, I **co-founded the US-based nonprofit Open Climate Research Collective (OCRC)**, to reimagine scientific funding. More information about supporting or receiving funding from OCRC can be found [here](https://openclimateresearch.org/).

Outside of academics, I am a **multi-instrumentalist** currently writing and recording a solo EP capturing the lifestyle and culture around ultra distance trail and mountain running. My show is unique because I try to play thoughtfully written music within a somewhat absurd arrangement of playing piano and drums at the same time. I also **run a lot**. I occupy that grey area of running where I can casually qualify for Boston but am light-years away from making the Olympic Trials. My preference is to run very long distances on trails, but right now I live in a flat New Jersey beach town. I make the best of it. Which is sometimes funny. And I sometimes write **comedy articles** about it. Links below.
