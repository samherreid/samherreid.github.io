I am an Alaska-raised, California-based geoscientist actively working on a diverse set of climate-focused projects:

- I work on **ice sheet dynamics in Antarctica** as a postdoc in Eric Rignot’s Research Group at the University of California Irvine


- In 2024 I co-founded Rubicon Exploration, a Paris-based startup working on developing **naturally occuring hydrogen** as a carbon-free energy source

- I am co-founder of Open Climate Research Collective (OCRC) a New Jersey based 501(c)(3) focused on using **immersive tech for science communication** and gamifying education 

- I am self-financing an Alaska Range glacier research project developing a numerical model to **predict how glaciers will look several hundreds of years into the future**

Probably my best scientific achievement so far is turning a research question I had at age 20 into a PhD and publishing it in **Nature Geoscience**. A close second is self-financing a research article about a glacier in the Alaska Range on tip money from **pouring latte art** at a cafe on the Jersey Shore during the pandemic.

Outside of academics, I study Gemara. And play music. I play piano and drums, sometimes at the same time, and sometimes for an audience. I also run a lot. I occupy that grey area of running where I can casually qualify for Boston but I’m light-years away from qualifying for the Olympic trials. My preference is to run very long distances on trails, but working on this ambitious list of science projects and השכמת בית המדרש שחרית וערבית doesn’t leave too much time to play. As a concession, I like to run ultra distances from my front door down the middle of highways through the night. An Alaskan trapped in an urban environment. I make the best of it. Which is sometimes funny. And I sometimes write comedy articles about it. Links below.
