I am a **self-financed glaciologist** with a specialization in understanding how rock debris on the surface of glaciers alters the melt rate of the ice below. My work on this subject extends up to the global scale, but I also have a specific focus on the Alaska Range: the mountain playground of my 20s and a poorly studied subset of Earth's glaciers. I am currently developing an open-source software package to model the next several hundreds years of debris cover evolution.

Self-financing science is not a particular desire of mine; however, it affords me the ability to focus strictly on the topics that I think I am best qualified to work on and for which I have the highest potential to make a societal impact. I am confident I am not the only scientist who has the potential for valuable scientific output but falls outside of the traditional academic model. This is why in early 2022, I **co-founded the US-based nonprofit Open Climate Research Collective (OCRC)**, to reimagine scientific funding for junior scientists. More information about supporting or receiving funding from OCRC can be found [here](https://openclimateresearch.org/).

Outside of academics, I am a **multi-instrumentalist** currently writing and recording a solo EP capturing the lifestyle and culture around ultra distance trail and mountain running. The music is inspired from my experiences racing and training around Europe and North America. My running also provides the underlying stories for **comedy running articles** in print and online running publications.  

In parallel to my science, running and music, I like being in touch with, and rooted to the community around me. I work part time in a cafe in Asbury Park, New Jersey and enjoy engaging with my customers while **fine-tuning the subtle craft of pouring latte art**.
