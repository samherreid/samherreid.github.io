Welcome to samherreid.io! A new hub for my content spanning a handful of, not always complementary, fixations. My first personal website, samherreid.org, went live in June 2018 as a primarily academic website. It had some footnotes to my other interests, but was built specifically for the eyes of potential employers. I never said â€˜â€˜fuckâ€™â€™ on samherreid.org. But things are changing...

Firstly, the domain extension. No one has time to comment on things, those that do occupy a beautiful few percentages of our population. When samherreid.org launched there wasnâ€™t public commenting, but a few people privately messaged me, laughing at my ambitious organization designation. It made some sense to me because it was a well-known extension and Iâ€™m not a commercial entity. But now that I am a co-founder of an actual nonprofit organization, I decided to switch my personal website to the trendy .io extension.

While this website still has a comprehensive presentation of my science, I decided to ditch the selective resume format and host all of my creative fields in on one central -- and not social media -- location. Am I still applying for postdocs with a link to this website on my CV? Yes ðŸ˜…, but I guess Iâ€™ve decided to be my whole self here, which means expect inline emojis and jokes about eating Tide Pods.

This new website has an uncomplicated comments section on all posts, articles and projects and I challenge you to be in the few percent who leave a comment, joke, question or criticism.
