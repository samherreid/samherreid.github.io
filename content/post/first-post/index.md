Welcome to the new samherreid.io, a hub for my content spanning several interests. My first personal webiste, samherreid.org, went live in June 2018 as a primarily academic website that had some footnotes of my other interests in life, but I built and updated the website with potential employers in mind. I never said â€˜â€˜fuckâ€™â€™ on samherreid.org, for example. But things are changing ðŸ˜‚

FIrst of all the domain. No one has time to comment on things, those that do occupy a beautiful few percentages of our population. When samherreid.org launched there wasnâ€™t public commenting but a few people privately messaged me, laughing at my ambitious organization designation. It made sense to me becasue it was a well known extension and Iâ€™m not a commercial entity, but now that I am co-running an actual nonprofit orginization, I decided to switch my personal website to the trendy .io extension.

While the website still has a comprehensive presentation of my science, I decided to ditch the selective resume format and host all of the fields I am creating in on one central, and not social media, location. Am I still applying for postdocs, with this website on my CV? Yes ðŸ˜… but I guess Iâ€™ve decided to be myself wholly here, which will probably include some fucks, emojis and jokes about eating Tide Pods ðŸ˜Š

This new website has an uncomplicated comments section on all posts and I challenge you to be the few percent and leave a comment, joke, question or criticism. Swearing encouraged.
