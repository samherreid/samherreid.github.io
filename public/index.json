These advances have established the importance of accounting for the melt-suppressing effect of rock debris when solving for glacier-sourced sea level rise. The next critical unknown is predicting how supraglacial debris cover will evolve in the future. To help address this unknown in a framework that scales globally, I have developed a new tool that uses geometric arguments alone to automatically derive a set of flowlines for each glacier. A machine learning model, trained on present day debris cover with bedrock geology and topography as input data, informs the erosive potential at the up-glacier provenance of each flowline which can in turn be used to populate, and then laterally evolve, debris cover along each flowline. Once fully trained, this approach will rely on only two effectively stable properties, bedrock geology and topography, and any prescribed glacier extent. The independence from measured or modeled ice dynamics means input can be a paleo ice sheet, a future ice extent or a pile of snow in your backyard. The intention of this method is to arrive at a computationally cheap prediction of past or future debris cover extent while accounting for complex glacier geometries and explicitly predicting medial moraines. This method is being developed in an annotated, open-source Jupyter notebook and high-density glacier flowlines derived for this work may have other applications in glaciology.","tags":[],"title":"Combining Bedrock Geology and a New Glacier Flowline Tool to Model Debris Cover Evolution (C12B-0572)","type":"event"},{"authors":["Sam Herreid"],"categories":null,"content":"Welcome to samherreid.io!

Growing up in Alaska’s interior is sort of like growing up ultra-Orthodox in Williamsburg, at some point during adolescence you start to comprehend that choices made by an earlier generation put your most crucial years of development in an all-immersive environment several deviations from the norm. Just like growing up in an insular Hasidic community, an Alaskan upbringing has its pros and cons. The obvious pros include a closeness to raw wilderness, big mountains, and unadulterated exploration. There are other pros too, like a deep sense of individuality and you can play the drums at 2 a.m. without upsetting your neighbors – because you don’t have any. The cons include grocery store produce so devoid of nutrients you’ll probably develop scurvy, being disconnected from everything that’s actually happening in the world, and air that assaults your skin 8 months out of the year.\nWhen I left Alaska to get a PhD in Glaciology in northeast England, it was a rude awakening that: (1) social skills are key to human survival and (2) life outside of Alaska is absurdly mundane, to the point of attempting to eat a Tide Pod just so there’s something to talk about. I’m convinced that relentless political news cycles, televised sports, holiday traditions, and all other time-intensive mainstays of typical life are placeholders – filling time before the next Alaskan adventure.

Of our planet’s two poles, the Arctic is particularly unique because it shares a hemisphere with the majority of Earth’s landmass, yet itself consists almost entirely of ocean. This means that for both early explorers and modern scientists alike, there have been no emergency structures, gear caches or landing strips. For the past several centuries and to this day, nearly all of human movement in the Arctic has been done by boat or over frozen sea ice. Early explorers, like Franklin and Nansen, dispatched accounts of an inhospitable, endless frozen expanse with ship-crushing sea ice and a relentless polar winter that claims all but the absolutely best prepared during the never-ending night. This imagery is nested into our minds from a young age, but that Arctic Ocean is rapidly disappearing. In 2016, a family of 7, including 5 children, sailed the Northwest Passage in a 15m sailboat. In 2017 a non-ice reinforced Russian tanker traveled the Northern Sea Route along the coast of Siberia from Norway to South Korea for the first time in history. Although the entire Earth is experiencing climate-related changes at an alarming rate, nowhere is the change more striking as in the Arctic Ocean and its surrounding coastlines. Every second or third year marks a new low record in sea ice extent, age and thickness, causing an ice-free summer Arctic Ocean to rapidly transition from a hypothetical mind-exercise to a new reality.

Somewhere south and east of Fairbanks, Alaska there’s a little town that has a Russian grocery store. This is not entirely unexpected. For several hundred years beginning in the 17th century, Russian traders and trappers rampaged across the Alaskan landscape like spurned lovers, murdering seals, whales, and indigenous peoples with unbounded enthusiasm, and they made a great deal of money in the process. In time, this colonial regime was replaced by another one, this time from the south. The Americans took over Alaska officially in 1867 and have managed its seals, whales, and indigenous peoples like one might manage a livestock business. But the Russian influence persists in the state. Children can learn Russian in school; there are Russian immigrant communities. And, to serve this niche population, there are various shops stocked with Russian goods.\nInside this grocery store, though, hidden between shelves of strange foods with cyrillic labels, the persistent shopper can root out a store of frozen pizzas. And it’s this hoard that has many times served the last-minute needs of a young glaciologist named Sam Herreid, who spent so much time in his office at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, double-checking batteries, cameras, and fancy thermal sensors for his field trips onto the glacier that he forgot to include what you might call batteries for himself, namely food. Realizing after driving out of the thin suburbs of his hometown into one of the largest wildernesses on Earth that he hadn’t actually packed anything to eat, he was often grateful to skid to a stop in front of the grocery store and emerge shortly thereafter with several frozen pizzas.\nRead the rest of this article written by Dakota Jones on Medium, and come back here to leave a comment :)\n","date":1614902400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614902400,"objectID":"87607d488b8484e947be422c14088e90","permalink":"https://samherreid.github.io/post/dakota/","publishdate":"2021-03-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/dakota/","section":"post","summary":"A biography of my work and running written by professional trail runner Dakota Jones","tags":null,"title":"A Glacier Scientist Goes Running","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Published in Trailrunner Magazine, online and in print.

These datasets are often derived using operator-biased and time-consuming manual delineation approaches, despite the recent emergence of semi-automatic mapping methods. These methods have used elevation or multispectral data, but the varying slope and mixed spectral signal of these dynamic features makes the transferability of these ap-proaches particularly challenging. We develop three semi-automated and objective new approaches, based on the Spectral Curvature and Linear Spectral Unmixing of multispectral images, to map these features at a glacier to regional scale. The transferability of each method is assessed by applying it to three sites in the Himalaya, where debris-covered glaciers are  widespread, with  varying lithologic, glaciological and  climatic settings, and encompassing different periods of the melt season. We develop the new methods keeping in mind the wide range of remote sensing platforms currently in use, and focus in particular on two products, we apply the three ap-proaches at each site to near-contemporaneous atmospherically-corrected Pl ́eiades (2 m resolution) and Sentinel- 2 (10 m resolution) images and assess the effects of spatial and spectral resolution on the results. We find that the Spectral Curvature method works best  for  the  high  spatial resolution, four  band Pl ́eaides images, while a modification of the Linear Spectral Unmixing using the scaling factor of the unmixing is best for the coarser spatial resolution, but additional spectral information of Sentinel-2 products. In both cases ice cliffs are mapped with a Dice coefficient higher than 0.48. Comparison of the Pl ́eiades results with other existing methods shows that the Spectral Curvature approach performs better and is more robust than any other existing automated or semi-automated approaches. Both methods outline a high number of small, sometimes shallow-sloping and thinly debris-covered ice patches that differ from our traditional understanding of cliffs but may have non-negligible impact on the mass balance of debris-covered glaciers. Overall these results pave the way for large scale ef-forts of ice cliff mapping that can enable inclusion of these features in debris-covered glacier melt models, as well as allow the generation of multiple datasets to study processes of cliff formation, evolution and decline.","tags":[],"title":"Mapping ice cliffs on debris-covered glaciers using multispectral satellite images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sam Herreid","Francesca Pellicciotti"],"categories":null,"content":" A summary of this paper written in accessable language for the Nature Sustainability Community “Behind the Paper” series is available here.

Glaciers from a variety of mountain ranges around the world have been classified as surge type, yet consensus of what defines a glacier as surge type has not always been met. A common source of dispute is the lack of a succinct and globally applicable delimiter between a surging and nonsurging glacier. The attempt is often a Boolean classification; however, glacier speedup events can vary significantly with respect to event magnitude, duration, and the fraction of the glacier that participates in the speedup. For this study, we first updated the inventory of glaciers that show flow instabilities in the Alaska Range and then quantified the spectrum of speedup behavior. We developed a new method that automatically detects glaciers with flow instabilities. Our automated results show a 91% success rate when compared to direct observations of speedup events and glaciers that are suspected to display unstable flow based on surface features. Through a combination of observations from the Landsat archive and previously published data, our inventory now contains 36 glaciers that encompass at least one branch exhibiting unstable flow and we document 53 speedup events that occurred between 1936 and 2014. We then present a universal method for comparing glacier speedup events based on a normalized event magnitude metric. This method provides a consistent way to include and quantify the full spectrum of speedup events and allows for comparisons with glaciers that exhibit clear surge characteristics yet have no observed surge event to date. Our results show a continuous spectrum of speedup magnitudes, from steady flow to clearly surge type, which suggests that qualitative classifications, such as “surge‐type” or “pulse‐type” behavior, might be too simplistic and should be accompanied by a standardized magnitude metric.","tags":["Alaska","Surge-type glaciers"],"title":"Automated detection of unstable glacier flow and a spectrum of speedup behavior in the Alaska Range","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sam Herreid","Francesca Pellicciotti","Alvaro Ayala","Anna Chesnokova","Christian Kienholz","Joseph Shea","Arun Shrestha"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1427846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1427846400,"objectID":"7fd223ddbbe87c573a95c2d732b600eb","permalink":"https://samherreid.github.io/publication/pakistan/","publishdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pakistan/","section":"publication","summary":"Spatial evolution of supraglacial debris cover on mountain glaciers is a largely unmonitored and poorly understood phenomenon that directly affects glacier melt.

The time series of debris-covered surface area change shows a mean value of zero or near-zero change for both surging and non-surging glaciers. An increase in debris-covered area is often associated with negative regional mass balances. We extend this logic to suggest that the stable regional mass balances in the Karakoram explain the zero or near-zero change in debris-covered area.

Preliminary analysis of the glacier database yields a new set of well-constrained area/length scaling parameters and shows good agreement between our area–altitude distributions and previously established synthetic hypsometries.

However, several studies have suggested that debris-covered glaciers in the Himalaya might have lost mass at a rate similar to debris-free glaciers. We reconstruct elevation and mass changes for the debris-covered glaciers of the upper Langtang valley, Nepalese Himalaya, using a digital elevation model (DEM) from 1974 stereo Hexagon satellite data and the 2000 SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEM. Uncertainties are high in the accumulation areas, due to data gaps in the SRTM and difficulties with delineation of the glacier borders. Even with these uncertainties, we obtain thinning rates comparable to those of several other studies in the Himalaya. In particular, we obtain a total mass balance for the investigated debris-covered glaciers of the basin of –0.32 ± 0.18 m w.e. a−1. However, there are major spatial differences both between glaciers and within any single glacier, exhibiting a very distinct nonlinear mass-balance profile with elevation. Through analysis of surface velocities derived from Landsat ETM+ imagery, we show that thinning occurs in areas of low velocity and low slope. These areas are prone to a general, dynamic decay of surface features and to the development of supraglacial lakes and ice cliffs, which may be responsible for a considerable increase in overall glacier ablation.","tags":["Himalaya"],"title":"Mass-balance changes of the debris-covered glaciers in the Langtang Himal, Nepal, from 1974 to 1999","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tad Pfeffer","Anthony Arendt","Andrew Bliss","16 others and the 'The Randolph Consortium' including","Sam Herreid"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1396310400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1396310400,"objectID":"cfc87f4a1d9f86693a3a63983028b1c5","permalink":"https://samherreid.github.io/publication/rgi/","publishdate":"2014-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rgi/","section":"publication","summary":"The Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) is a globally complete collection of digital outlines of glaciers, excluding the ice sheets, developed to meet the needs of the Fifth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for estimates of past and future mass balance. The RGI was created with limited resources in a short period. Priority was given to completeness of coverage, but a limited, uniform set of attributes is attached to each of the ~198 000 glaciers in its latest version, 3.2. Satellite imagery from 1999–2010 provided most of the outlines. Their total extent is estimated as 726 800 ± 34 000 km2. The uncertainty, about ±5%, is derived from careful single-glacier and basin-scale uncertainty estimates and comparisons with inventories that were not sources for the RGI. The main contributors to uncertainty are probably misinterpretation of seasonal snow cover and debris cover. These errors appear not to be normally distributed, and quantifying them reliably is an unsolved problem. Combined with digital elevation models, the RGI glacier outlines yield hypsometries that can be combined with atmospheric data or model outputs for analysis of the impacts of climatic change on glaciers.

We present a new method that calculates ice thickness via an estimate of ice flux. We solve the familiar continuity equation between adjacent flowlines, which decreases the computational time required compared to a solution on the whole grid. We test the method on Columbia Glacier, a large tidewater glacier in Alaska, USA, and compare calculated and measured ice thicknesses, with favorable results. This shows the potential of this method for estimating ice thickness distribution of glaciers for which only surface data are available. We find that both the mean thickness and volume of Columbia Glacier were approximately halved over the period 1957–2007, from 281 m to 143 m, and from 294 km3 to 134 km3, respectively. Using bedrock slope and considering how waves of thickness change propagate through the glacier, we conduct a brief analysis of the instability of Columbia Glacier, which leads us to conclude that the rapid portion of the retreat may be nearing an end.","tags":["Alaska"],"title":"Using surface velocities to calculate ice thickness and bed topography, a case study at Columbia Glacier, Alaska, USA","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1303862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1303862400,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://samherreid.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2011-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"A nonprofit focused on restructuring science financing","tags":null,"title":"Open Climate Research Collective","type":"project"},{"authors":["Robert Burrows","Sam Herreid","Guy Adema","Anthony Arendt",""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1301616000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1301616000,"objectID":"2b33d43da1ed74a5d1d10df1973eaa43","permalink":"https://samherreid.github.io/publication/dnp/","publishdate":"2011-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dnp/","section":"publication","summary":"Glaciers cover approximately one-sixth of Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska. They are not only enjoyed by visitors for their scenic and recreational values but are also an important driver of Denali's diverse ecosystems by defining the hydrologic regime, generating landscape-scale braided river systems, and shaping the landforms of the Alaska Range. Scientists from the National Park Service and University of Alaska-Fairbanks have been researching glacier dynamics and monitoring glacier trends for more than 20 years using glacier outlining from satellite imagery, index mass balance measurements, longitudinal elevation profiles, repeat photography, analysis of regional gravity changes, and other localized research. Mass balance measurements on the Traleika and Kahiltna glaciers showed a cumulative net gain of mass from 1991 to 2003. Since 2003 the mass balance data and satellite-based gravimetric analysis show a net loss of ice mass. Airborne laser and lidar elevation profiles corroborate the mass balance measurements and also show localized changes because of glacier dynamics. Analysis of glacier extent reveals an 8% loss in area since 1950; however, whereas most glaciers lost area, a few surge-type glaciers gained area. Repeated photographs from historical images help refine trends seen in other methods and include dramatic examples of smaller glaciers decreasing in size and a surge-type glacier that has not changed as noticeably. Relations to climate trends are complicated and clearly demonstrate the importance of local influences on glacier behavior and trends. Losses of ice from smaller glaciers and dramatic changes of other glaciers in Alaska suggest that global climatic change may be overwhelming the dominant influence of large-scale climate oscillations on glacier change in Denali.","tags":["Alaska"],"title":"Glacier trends and response to climate in Denali National Park and Preserve","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rGIS-based research is a perfect medium for visual learners, however, as your analysis becomes more sophisticated you might end up using a strictly programming environment.

Landslides are shown in red and letters correspond to the locations of the images below.\n(a) In 2010, Andy Sterns and I camped for two weeks on the West Fork Robertson Glacier. Our tent was on the medial moraine just below the arrow.\n(a) When we returned to the same spot in 2011 a fresh landslide had been deposited almost exactly where our camp was the previous year. The arrows point to the same location in both images. Notice how the debris “jumped” over the medial moraine! Glaciers, and the rock debris on top of them, are in constant state of flux.\n(a) Investigating the debris from the landslide shown above. Andy Sterns for scale. Notice the rock size and size distribution: small and uniform.\n(b) In contrast to the image above. Investigating landslide debris on the West Fork Glacier (Hayes Range). Andy Sterns for scale, standing on a house sized rock.\n(c) West Fork Roberson Glacier, landslide deposition ~1981. Notice the ridge along the perimeter of the landslide, this is common but not always present.\n(d) Downward-looking thermal image captured during a flight with Martin Truffer over Black Rapids Glacier. Several landslides on Black Rapids Glacier, along with many others all arcoss the Alaska Range, were deposited during the 2002 Denali Fault earthquake. Notice the shading effect on surface temperature from the giant boulders and the “cold” spots on the meters thick debris cover.\n(e) One of the several landslides deposited onto Gakona Glacier in 2002. Maybe it goes without saying, but the winter biking here turns out to be awful.\n","date":988329600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":988329600,"objectID":"3133ea485f47895835509cbb4d7b559a","permalink":"https://samherreid.github.io/project/landslides/","publishdate":"2001-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/landslides/","section":"project","summary":"Half hobby / half research interest, visiting supraglacial landslides in the Alaska Range","tags":["Debris cover","Landslides","Glacier Research"],"title":"Landslides on glaciers","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Development of Debris Cover Tools (DCT) started in May 2018. The intent was an open-source suite of Python based tools that any climate modeler could easily run to add the effects of debris cover to their work in a modular form. At the time, and still today, many global glacier models neglect debris cover entirely.\nWhile it’s not a top development priority for me, all of the small scripts I write will eventually be packaged into a cohesive DCT Jupyter notebook for either community use or just to sit and accumulate dust on github. Several of the tools I have developed have been published in peer-reviewed articles and they are linked below.\nWhile it’s annoying and not open-source, I use the package arcpy (I pay $100USD/year to have a licence). Being something of an indusrty standard makes it slightly okay, I think, but I would one day like for these tool to run exclusivly with open-source Python packages.\nThe preamble to DCT version 1 – defining source data and variables:\n## Debris Cover Tools ## Version 1.0 ## ## By Sam Herreid (samherreid@gmail.com) ## ## A suite of automated tools to: ## Map supraglacial debris cover (DebisMap.py) ## Locate ice cliffs (DebrisAreaSegmentation.py, IceCliffLocation.py) ## Locate supraglacial lakes/ponds [in prep., not in v1.0] ## Measure changes in debris cover [in prep., not in v1.0] ## Calculate debris map and area change omission and commission errors [in prep., not in v1.0] ## Identify glacier flow instabilities (optional: in near real time) [in prep., not in v1.0] ## ## For use of Debris Cover Tools v1.0, required input data are: ## Glacier outline(s) (.shp) ## Landsat TM, ETM+, or OLI images (.tif, do not change default file names) ## Digital Elevation Model roughly coincident in time with Landsat imagery (.tif, aprox. 5m resolution) ## ## Required software are: ## ArcGIS/arcpy (advanced licence, proprietary) ## Python (2.x to be compatible with arcpy) ## numpy (Python package) ## scipy (Python package) ## matplotlib (Python package) ## ## Please cite the following article(s) if using this code to ## ## map ice cliffs: ## Herreid, Sam, and Francesca Pellicciotti. \u0026#34;Automated detection of ice cliffs within supraglacial debris cover.\u0026#34; The Cryosphere, 2018. ## ## derive debris area changes [code in prep., not in v1.0]: ## Herreid, Sam, et al. \u0026#34;Satellite observations show no net change in the percentage of supraglacial debris-covered area in northern Pakistan from 1977 to 2014.\u0026#34; Journal of Glaciology 61.227 (2015): 524-536. ## ## detect glacier flow instabilities [code in prep., not in v1.0]: ## Herreid, Sam, and Martin Truffer. \u0026#34;Automated detection of unstable glacier flow and a spectrum of speedup behavior in the Alaska Range.\u0026#34; Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface 121.1 (2016): 64-81. ## ##-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ## ## To use Debris Cover Tools, follow the directions in comments and boxes like this: ###-------------------------------------------### ### Directions ### ###-------------------------------------------### ##-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ###-------------------------------------------### ### What do you want? ### ###-------------------------------------------### Want_DebrisMap = \u0026#39;True\u0026#39; # DEFINE: workspace, data_dir, shp_dir, mask_dir (mask_dir currently does nothing in v1.0) Want_CloudRemoval = \u0026#39;False\u0026#39; # in prep., not in v1.0, \u0026#39;True\u0026#39; will not currently work Want_SupraglacialPondLocation = \u0026#39;False\u0026#39; # in prep., not in v1.0, \u0026#39;True\u0026#39; will not currently work Want_IceCliff = \u0026#39;True\u0026#39; # DEFINE: workspace, data_dir, shp_dir and dem (that is relatively coincident in time with Landsat (ETM+ or OLI) image). if Want_DebrisMap = \u0026#39;False\u0026#39;, also define: debarea; Want_dDebris = \u0026#39;False\u0026#39; # in prep., not in v1.0, \u0026#39;True\u0026#39; will not currently work Want_LocateUnstableFlow = \u0026#39;False\u0026#39; # in prep., not in v1.0, \u0026#39;True\u0026#39; will not currently work ###-------------------------------------------### ### Define directories here: ### ###-------------------------------------------### # Example format for directories: \u0026#34;C:\\\\Users\\\\Sam\\\\Desktop\\\\CanwellGlacier\\\\\u0026#34; or r\u0026#34;C:\\Users\\Sam\\Desktop\\CanwellGlacier\\\u0026#34; or \u0026#34;C:/Users/Sam/Desktop/CanwellGlacier/\u0026#34; # Replace the example paths below to your local data.
