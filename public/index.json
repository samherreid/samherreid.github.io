These advances have established the importance of accounting for the melt-suppressing effect of rock debris when solving for glacier-sourced sea level rise. The next critical unknown is predicting how supraglacial debris cover will evolve in the future. To help address this unknown in a framework that scales globally, I have developed a new tool that uses geometric arguments alone to automatically derive a set of flowlines for each glacier. A machine learning model, trained on present day debris cover with bedrock geology and topography as input data, informs the erosive potential at the up-glacier provenance of each flowline which can in turn be used to populate, and then laterally evolve, debris cover along each flowline. Once fully trained, this approach will rely on only two effectively stable properties, bedrock geology and topography, and any prescribed glacier extent. The independence from measured or modeled ice dynamics means input can be a paleo ice sheet, a future ice extent or a pile of snow in your backyard. The intention of this method is to arrive at a computationally cheap prediction of past or future debris cover extent while accounting for complex glacier geometries and explicitly predicting medial moraines. This method is being developed in an annotated, open-source Jupyter notebook and high-density glacier flowlines derived for this work may have other applications in glaciology.","tags":[],"title":"Combining Bedrock Geology and a New Glacier Flowline Tool to Model Debris Cover Evolution (C12B-0572)","type":"event"},{"authors":["Sam Herreid"],"categories":null,"content":"Welcome to the new samherreid.io, a hub for my content spanning several interests.

We reveal the role of bend evolution in mountain building with physical experiments scaled to simulate the Alaska Mount McKinley restraining bend (MMRB). Despite the natural complexity of the MMRB, first-order patterns (of strike-slip separation rates, uplift and lateral bend migration) from the geologic data align with patterns from scaled experiments. Thermochronology, seismicity, and slip rate data show that the persistence of a single Denali Fault strand through the ~6 Ma MMRB is facilitated by simultaneous advection of crust through the bend and migration of the eastern vertex of the bend.","tags":["Alaska"],"title":"Why is Denali (6,194 m) so big?

Of our planet’s two poles, the Arctic is particularly unique because it shares a hemisphere with the majority of Earth’s landmass, yet itself consists almost entirely of ocean. This means that for both early explorers and modern scientists alike, there have been no emergency structures, gear caches or landing strips. For the past several centuries and to this day, nearly all of human movement in the Arctic has been done by boat or over frozen sea ice. Early explorers, like Franklin and Nansen, dispatched accounts of an inhospitable, endless frozen expanse with ship-crushing sea ice and a relentless polar winter that claims all but the absolutely best prepared during the never-ending night. This imagery is nested into our minds from a young age, but that Arctic Ocean is rapidly disappearing. In 2016, a family of 7, including 5 children, sailed the Northwest Passage in a 15m sailboat. In 2017 a non-ice reinforced Russian tanker traveled the Northern Sea Route along the coast of Siberia from Norway to South Korea for the first time in history. Although the entire Earth is experiencing climate-related changes at an alarming rate, nowhere is the change more striking as in the Arctic Ocean and its surrounding coastlines. Every second or third year marks a new low record in sea ice extent, age and thickness, causing an ice-free summer Arctic Ocean to rapidly transition from a hypothetical mind-exercise to a new reality. The Arctic Ocean is entering a new chapter of its existence and it is up to us to document and weigh trying to mitigate it.","tags":["The Arctic"],"title":"Losing the Arctic (Book Chapter)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marin Kneib","Evan Miles","Simone Jola","Pascal Buri","Sam Herreid","Atanu Bhattacharya","C.

These datasets are often derived using operator-biased and time-consuming manual delineation approaches, despite the recent emergence of semi-automatic mapping methods. These methods have used elevation or multispectral data, but the varying slope and mixed spectral signal of these dynamic features makes the transferability of these ap-proaches particularly challenging. We develop three semi-automated and objective new approaches, based on the Spectral Curvature and Linear Spectral Unmixing of multispectral images, to map these features at a glacier to regional scale. The transferability of each method is assessed by applying it to three sites in the Himalaya, where debris-covered glaciers are  widespread, with  varying lithologic, glaciological and  climatic settings, and encompassing different periods of the melt season. We develop the new methods keeping in mind the wide range of remote sensing platforms currently in use, and focus in particular on two products, we apply the three ap-proaches at each site to near-contemporaneous atmospherically-corrected Pl ́eiades (2 m resolution) and Sentinel- 2 (10 m resolution) images and assess the effects of spatial and spectral resolution on the results. We find that the Spectral Curvature method works best  for  the  high  spatial resolution, four  band Pl ́eaides images, while a modification of the Linear Spectral Unmixing using the scaling factor of the unmixing is best for the coarser spatial resolution, but additional spectral information of Sentinel-2 products. In both cases ice cliffs are mapped with a Dice coefficient higher than 0.48. Comparison of the Pl ́eiades results with other existing methods shows that the Spectral Curvature approach performs better and is more robust than any other existing automated or semi-automated approaches. Both methods outline a high number of small, sometimes shallow-sloping and thinly debris-covered ice patches that differ from our traditional understanding of cliffs but may have non-negligible impact on the mass balance of debris-covered glaciers. Overall these results pave the way for large scale ef-forts of ice cliff mapping that can enable inclusion of these features in debris-covered glacier melt models, as well as allow the generation of multiple datasets to study processes of cliff formation, evolution and decline.","tags":[],"title":"Mapping ice cliffs on debris-covered glaciers using multispectral satellite images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sam Herreid","Francesca Pellicciotti"],"categories":null,"content":" A summary of this paper written in accessable language for the Nature Sustainability Community “Behind the Paper” series is available here.

Glaciers from a variety of mountain ranges around the world have been classified as surge type, yet consensus of what defines a glacier as surge type has not always been met. A common source of dispute is the lack of a succinct and globally applicable delimiter between a surging and nonsurging glacier. The attempt is often a Boolean classification; however, glacier speedup events can vary significantly with respect to event magnitude, duration, and the fraction of the glacier that participates in the speedup. For this study, we first updated the inventory of glaciers that show flow instabilities in the Alaska Range and then quantified the spectrum of speedup behavior. We developed a new method that automatically detects glaciers with flow instabilities. Our automated results show a 91% success rate when compared to direct observations of speedup events and glaciers that are suspected to display unstable flow based on surface features. Through a combination of observations from the Landsat archive and previously published data, our inventory now contains 36 glaciers that encompass at least one branch exhibiting unstable flow and we document 53 speedup events that occurred between 1936 and 2014. We then present a universal method for comparing glacier speedup events based on a normalized event magnitude metric. This method provides a consistent way to include and quantify the full spectrum of speedup events and allows for comparisons with glaciers that exhibit clear surge characteristics yet have no observed surge event to date. Our results show a continuous spectrum of speedup magnitudes, from steady flow to clearly surge type, which suggests that qualitative classifications, such as “surge‐type” or “pulse‐type” behavior, might be too simplistic and should be accompanied by a standardized magnitude metric.","tags":["Alaska","Surge-type glaciers"],"title":"Automated detection of unstable glacier flow and a spectrum of speedup behavior in the Alaska Range","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sam Herreid","Francesca Pellicciotti","Alvaro Ayala","Anna Chesnokova","Christian Kienholz","Joseph Shea","Arun Shrestha"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1427846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1427846400,"objectID":"7fd223ddbbe87c573a95c2d732b600eb","permalink":"https://samherreid.io/publication/pakistan/","publishdate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pakistan/","section":"publication","summary":"Spatial evolution of supraglacial debris cover on mountain glaciers is a largely unmonitored and poorly understood phenomenon that directly affects glacier melt. Supraglacial debris cover for 93 glaciers in the Karakoram, northern Pakistan, was mapped from Landsat imagery acquired in 1977, 1998, 2009 and 2014. Surge-type glaciers occupy 41\\% of the study area and were considered separately. The time series of debris-covered surface area change shows a mean value of zero or near-zero change for both surging and non-surging glaciers. An increase in debris-covered area is often associated with negative regional mass balances. We extend this logic to suggest that the stable regional mass balances in the Karakoram explain the zero or near-zero change in debris-covered area. This coupling of trends combined with our 37 year time series of data suggests the Karakoram anomaly extends further back in time than previously known.","tags":["Alaska"],"title":"Satellite observations show no net change in the percentage of supraglacial debris-covered area in northern Pakistan from 1977 to 2014","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Kienholz","Sam Herreid","Justin Rich","Anthony Arendt","Regine Hock","Evan Burgess"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1422748800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1422748800,"objectID":"5cb66efdb03c9ff1cb74b97cdc9bdd8d","permalink":"https://samherreid.io/publication/akinventory/","publishdate":"2015-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/akinventory/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a detailed, complete glacier inventory for Alaska and neighboring Canada using multi-sensor satellite data from 2000 to 2011.

We find 86 723 km2 of glacier area (27 109 glaciers \u003e0.025 km2), ∼12\\% of the global glacierized area outside ice sheets. Of this area 12.0% is drained by 39 marine-terminating glaciers (74 km of tidewater margin), and 19.3\\% by 148 lake- and river-terminating glaciers (420 km of lake-/river margin). The overall debris cover is 11\\%, with considerable differences among regions, ranging from 1.4\\% in the Kenai Mountains to 28\\% in the Central Alaska Range. Comparison of outlines from different sources on \u003e2500 km2 of glacierized area yields a total area difference of ∼10\\%, emphasizing the difficulties in accurately delineating debris-covered glaciers. Assuming fully correlated (systematic) errors, uncertainties in area reach 6\\% for all Alaska glaciers, but further analysis is needed to explore adequate error correlation scales. Preliminary analysis of the glacier database yields a new set of well-constrained area/length scaling parameters and shows good agreement between our area–altitude distributions and previously established synthetic hypsometries. The new glacier database will be valuable to further explore relations between glacier variables and glacier behavior.","tags":["Alaska"],"title":"Derivation and analysis of a complete modern-date glacier inventory for Alaska and northwest Canada","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francesca Pellicciotti","Christa Stephan","Evan Miles","Sam Herreid","Walter Immerzeel","Tobias Bolch"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"30ab9dd99f952ff11efab8b438746c30","permalink":"https://samherreid.io/publication/langtang/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/langtang/","section":"publication","summary":"Thick debris cover on glaciers can significantly reduce ice melt. However, several studies have suggested that debris-covered glaciers in the Himalaya might have lost mass at a rate similar to debris-free glaciers. We reconstruct elevation and mass changes for the debris-covered glaciers of the upper Langtang valley, Nepalese Himalaya, using a digital elevation model (DEM) from 1974 stereo Hexagon satellite data and the 2000 SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEM. Uncertainties are high in the accumulation areas, due to data gaps in the SRTM and difficulties with delineation of the glacier borders. Even with these uncertainties, we obtain thinning rates comparable to those of several other studies in the Himalaya. In particular, we obtain a total mass balance for the investigated debris-covered glaciers of the basin of –0.32 ± 0.18 m w.e. a−1. However, there are major spatial differences both between glaciers and within any single glacier, exhibiting a very distinct nonlinear mass-balance profile with elevation. Through analysis of surface velocities derived from Landsat ETM+ imagery, we show that thinning occurs in areas of low velocity and low slope. These areas are prone to a general, dynamic decay of surface features and to the development of supraglacial lakes and ice cliffs, which may be responsible for a considerable increase in overall glacier ablation.","tags":["Himalaya"],"title":"Mass-balance changes of the debris-covered glaciers in the Langtang Himal, Nepal, from 1974 to 1999","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tad Pfeffer","Anthony Arendt","Andrew Bliss","16 others and the 'The Randolph Consortium' including","Sam Herreid"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1396310400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1396310400,"objectID":"cfc87f4a1d9f86693a3a63983028b1c5","permalink":"https://samherreid.io/publication/rgi/","publishdate":"2014-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/rgi/","section":"publication","summary":"The Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) is a globally complete collection of digital outlines of glaciers, excluding the ice sheets, developed to meet the needs of the Fifth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for estimates of past and future mass balance.

Priority was given to completeness of coverage, but a limited, uniform set of attributes is attached to each of the ~198 000 glaciers in its latest version, 3.2. Satellite imagery from 1999–2010 provided most of the outlines. Their total extent is estimated as 726 800 ± 34 000 km2. The uncertainty, about ±5%, is derived from careful single-glacier and basin-scale uncertainty estimates and comparisons with inventories that were not sources for the RGI. The main contributors to uncertainty are probably misinterpretation of seasonal snow cover and debris cover. These errors appear not to be normally distributed, and quantifying them reliably is an unsolved problem. Combined with digital elevation models, the RGI glacier outlines yield hypsometries that can be combined with atmospheric data or model outputs for analysis of the impacts of climatic change on glaciers. The RGI has already proved its value in the generation of significantly improved aggregate estimates of glacier mass changes and total volume, and thus actual and potential contributions to sea-level rise.","tags":["Global"],"title":"The Randolph Glacier Inventory, a globally complete inventory of glaciers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Mcnabb","Regine Hock","Shad O’Neel","Al Rasmussen","Y.

We present a new method that calculates ice thickness via an estimate of ice flux. We solve the familiar continuity equation between adjacent flowlines, which decreases the computational time required compared to a solution on the whole grid. We test the method on Columbia Glacier, a large tidewater glacier in Alaska, USA, and compare calculated and measured ice thicknesses, with favorable results. This shows the potential of this method for estimating ice thickness distribution of glaciers for which only surface data are available. We find that both the mean thickness and volume of Columbia Glacier were approximately halved over the period 1957–2007, from 281 m to 143 m, and from 294 km3 to 134 km3, respectively. Using bedrock slope and considering how waves of thickness change propagate through the glacier, we conduct a brief analysis of the instability of Columbia Glacier, which leads us to conclude that the rapid portion of the retreat may be nearing an end.","tags":["Alaska"],"title":"Using surface velocities to calculate ice thickness and bed topography, a case study at Columbia Glacier, Alaska, USA","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1303862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1303862400,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://samherreid.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2011-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"A nonprofit focused on restructuring science financing","tags":null,"title":"Open Climate Research Collective","type":"project"},{"authors":["Robert Burrows","Sam Herreid","Guy Adema","Anthony Arendt",""],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1301616000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1301616000,"objectID":"2b33d43da1ed74a5d1d10df1973eaa43","permalink":"https://samherreid.io/publication/dnp/","publishdate":"2011-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dnp/","section":"publication","summary":"Glaciers cover approximately one-sixth of Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska. They are not only enjoyed by visitors for their scenic and recreational values but are also an important driver of Denali's diverse ecosystems by defining the hydrologic regime, generating landscape-scale braided river systems, and shaping the landforms of the Alaska Range. Scientists from the National Park Service and University of Alaska-Fairbanks have been researching glacier dynamics and monitoring glacier trends for more than 20 years using glacier outlining from satellite imagery, index mass balance measurements, longitudinal elevation profiles, repeat photography, analysis of regional gravity changes, and other localized research. Mass balance measurements on the Traleika and Kahiltna glaciers showed a cumulative net gain of mass from 1991 to 2003. Since 2003 the mass balance data and satellite-based gravimetric analysis show a net loss of ice mass. Airborne laser and lidar elevation profiles corroborate the mass balance measurements and also show localized changes because of glacier dynamics. Analysis of glacier extent reveals an 8% loss in area since 1950; however, whereas most glaciers lost area, a few surge-type glaciers gained area. Repeated photographs from historical images help refine trends seen in other methods and include dramatic examples of smaller glaciers decreasing in size and a surge-type glacier that has not changed as noticeably. Relations to climate trends are complicated and clearly demonstrate the importance of local influences on glacier behavior and trends. Losses of ice from smaller glaciers and dramatic changes of other glaciers in Alaska suggest that global climatic change may be overwhelming the dominant influence of large-scale climate oscillations on glacier change in Denali.","tags":["Alaska"],"title":"Glacier trends and response to climate in Denali National Park and Preserve","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"GIS-based research is a perfect medium for visual learners, however, as your analysis becomes more sophisticated you might end up using a strictly programming environment.
